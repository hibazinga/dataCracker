# How to run the code:
0. IMPORTANT NOTIFICATIONS: 
   1) Before you try to run the code, please make sure that all the files needed in the program are set right (especially the file paths).
   2) If you encounter some problems when try to run the code, please contact any member of our group for help.

1. Pre-processing:
• python step1.py #filter out dummy user• python step2.py #filter out dummy user• python step3.py #time-based session slicing• python step4.py #user group division• python step5.py #generate keyword matrix• python step6.py #generate user social network matrix• python step7.py #generate training matrix Rui

2. Training Model:
   In our project, we divided the users into 11 groups according to their genders & ages. So we build different models for each group separately.

   1) $ make

   2) $ ./a.out [group-id]

   3) Wait for about 10-15 minutes (time may vary according to the amount of training data). If you see a "segmentation fault" or "out of memory" in your terminal, clear the cache and run it again. After that, you will see a modelx.csv in the corresponding folder.
      $ sudo purge; ./a.out

3. Prediction & Evaluation:
   1) If you only want to get the predict result for all the users (both inactive and active users included), just do the following steps
      python generate_inactive_relation_active.py
      python predict.py
      python MAP.py

   2) If you want to get the predict result for the active users belong to a certain group, do the following steps
      python generate_inactive_relation_active.py (if you run this command in 1, there is no need to run it again)
      python one-group-predict.py group_number (here group_number should be one of 1~11)
      python one-group-MAP.py group_number (here group_number should be one of 1~11)

   3) If you want to get the predict result for "Public" solution (please see "KDD_Track1_solution.csv" to see which clicks are "Public")
      python generate_inactive_relation_active.py (if you run this command in 1, there is no need to run it again)
      python predict-public.py
      python MAP-public.py

   4) If you want to get the predict result for "Private" solution (please see "KDD_Track1_solution.csv" to see which clicks are "Priavte")
      python generate_inactive_relation_active.py (if you run this command in 1, there is no need to run it again)
      python predict-private.py
      python MAP-private.py
